# Snipping Tool OCR

##### Supported OS: WIN 10

```
git clone https://github.com/pijusrancevas/SnippingToolOCR.git
```

Works exactly as native Windows 10 Snipping Tool application, however, after the screenshot is taken it is translated from any language (except for Russian and Asian language families) directly to English.
